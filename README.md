# Universal_Clicker

Some manner of idle clicking game, a mess of JS code from random tutorials from Internets. I'm doing this just to re-learn and rekindle and justify my hatred of JavaScript so it will be pure JS jammed into html :)
Current goals:
Get all half implemented stuff working before adding more stuff.


Credits things;
Minefield; Largely based on "How To Build A Minesweeper Clone With JavaScript" from Web Dev Simplified; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBMnD_aElCQ

Tons of CSS from W3 Schools; https://www.w3schools.com/

CRT Effect Based on;

Sound encoding, because it sounds like a cool idea to have more stuff than linking actual sound files; https://base64.guru/converter/encode/audio
